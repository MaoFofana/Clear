- Contains utilities for creating windowed programs with simple looping functionality
- Has classes for making input callbacks for windows
- Has a TinyFileDialog wrapper class that allows you to open various message/open/save dialogs in one line each

## ClearVG
- Create a NanoVG-capable application within 30 lines
- Has basic tools for making pretty user-interfaces
- Provides tools and detailed documentation on how to make your own
